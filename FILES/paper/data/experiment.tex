\section{Results}
Observe that with the exponential loss, Deepboost has a smaller test error than Adaboost, which is in accordance with Cortes et al.’s work\cite{cortes2014deep}.
Noise (realistic), in general, does not affect the boosting algorithms harshly, which is different from Dietterich’s work\cite{dietterich2000experimental}.
As is reported from Cortes et al. it is difficult to obtain statistically significant results for small datasets.
Therefore, the level of the testing error at approximately less than 10\% is acceptable.

Figure \ref{adaiono} shows the training error and test error of Adaboost of the original ionosphere dataset,
while figure \ref{adaionon5} to \ref{adaionon20} shows the training error and test error with the introduced noise of
corresponding level of 5\%, 10\% and 20\%. On the other hand, figure \ref{adaIonoDeep} to \ref{adaIonoDeepn20} shows the training
and test error of Deepboost on those datasets with noise.

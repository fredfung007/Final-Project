Based on the margin theory, we introduced a new realistic way of simulating realistic noise in training data, ]
and utilized it to introduce noise into our experiments against these algorithms.
We presented a practical analysis of the robustness of two boosting algorithm, Adaboost and Deepboost by adding
noise in a fasion as we argued to be realistic.
We also reported that both Adaboost and Deepboost has a good performance with the realistic noise we introduced.
Our work coinincides with multiple reports that boosting in general has a good performance in practice.
%Our experimental result also shed some new light on analysing the robustness of other algorithms.
